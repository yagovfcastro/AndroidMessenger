# Avatar Messenger
This was made with the only purpose of self improvement, but ended up being quite fun!

So, to be brief, this is a chat messenger app I built on Android Studio using Kotlin and Firebase Database.

## Register Interface
Here you can click on the Select Photo button to select your avatar.

If you don't have an account yet, you just have to fill in all the fields (make sure they are filled in correctly).

After registering, you'll be redirected to the Latest Messages Interface

## Login Interface
If you already have an account created, you can just click on the "Already have an account?" on the Register Interface and you will be brought here.

Just enter the email and the password you registered previously and you be redirected to the Latest Messages Interface.
